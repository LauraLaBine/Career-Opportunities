We are an intrinsically motivated team that works without ego, is constantly learning, and solves real problems for the cannabis industry. As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will work closely with our product team and with our customers to shape and deliver new features in all areas of the product. You will take ownership over key features that will have our customers writing you a personal “thank you” email like this one:

"I can’t praise this company enough, it’s head and shoulders above any platform I’ve encountered to date. Thank you for your persistence and for providing us with the right tools."

This is a full-time remote engineering role, but we are based in Oakland if you want to spend some time in person with some of the team.

You will: 
Design, build and maintain the API and infrastructure that powers our company.
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.
Debug production issues across the entire stack.
Work on tools and services to proactively improve the quality and reliability of our production API.
Develop simple and extensible data models for complex supply chain workflows, with a strong emphasis on data integrity.
Identify and fix security concerns.
Features you might work on

Improve our order fulfillment workflow that manages the entire distribution process from sale to the final delivery. This could include a mobile experience with barcode scanning and dashboard views of where orders are at in the process.
Establish the mobile experience for delivery drivers to help distributors manage dispatch more efficiently and track deliveries in real-time.
Integrations with numerous 3rd party services including billing, marketplaces, GPS tracking, calendar, data analytics.
Develop a robust data model for historical inventory tracking and valuation.
Your Experience

Ability to express complex involved logic through clean easy to understand code
Ability to add new logic to a system with many rules in a cohesive way
Ability to model new data in a database with a lot of different models
Ability to interact with stakeholders to raise concerns about potentially harming aspects of a feature
Experience writing high-quality code with effective test coverage. We work in Elixir (with Phoenix and Ecto), but languages can be learned; we care much more about general engineering skills than knowledge of any particular language or framework.
Significant experience with SQL databases (especially Postgres).
Strong written communication skills.
Experience developing a complex SaaS product is a plus!
Worked remotely, ideally on a distributed team is a plus! We emphasize thoughtful asynchronous communication and deep work over frequent interruptions.
